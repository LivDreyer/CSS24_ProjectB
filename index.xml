Figure 1: Main Data Sources.
We utilize data from APIs such as Spotify and Genius, supplemented by a Kaggle dataset, as the cornerstone of our analyses. This data collection process resembles a &amp;ldquo;chain reaction&amp;rdquo;, where Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;US Top 10K Artists and Their Popular Songs&amp;rdquo; dataset serves as the starting point.</description></item><item><title>Network analysis</title><link>https://LivDreyer.github.io/CSS24_ProjectB/network-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://LivDreyer.github.io/CSS24_ProjectB/network-analysis/</guid><description>Short introduction Repeat short motivation Using Kaggle and Spotify API, incl. link to data-description.md Introduction to networks Generally on social networks Theory from book?

This approach is interesting for several reasons:
Genre-Specific Themes: We would like to see if it is possible to identify genre-specific characteristics/themes. Analyzing these differences should help to define what sets the genres apart.
Comparative Analysis: By looking into the frequency and context of words within genres, we can identify which themes and words are predominant for each genre.</description></item></channel></rss>
